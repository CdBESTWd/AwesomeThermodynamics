|---|---|
>**TLK-Thermo GmbH**
> TLK-Thermo GmbH offers platform independent software products. We have a broad range of software related to physical modeling and simulation, interoperability between different programs as well as visualization software for both measurement and simulation data.

  * [TIL Suite](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/til-suite) – Simulates thermal systems
  > TIL Suite is suitable for the stationary and transient simulation of freely configurable thermodynamic systems. Thanks to the substance property library, TILMedia – a component of the TIL Suite – system simulations can be performed extremely quickly and accurately. The individual models in TIL are described using the modeling language Modelica. However, the use of these models is not limited to Modelica simulators; other simulation environments can also be used thanks to code-export and model exchange functions.

  * [TILMedia Suite](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/tilmedia-suite) – Software package for calculating the properties of thermophysical substances
  > TILMedia Suite provides methods of calculation, which express the thermophysical properties of incompressible liquids, ideal gases and real fluids containing a vapor liquid equilibrium. Methods for calculating the properties of mixtures are also included. TILMedia provides a comprehensive range of different substances, including our own highly efficient and accurate real-time substance property implementations.

  * [TISC Suite](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/tisc-suite) – Software package for coupling simulation tools
  > TISC is a co-simulation environment that makes it possible to connect calculation models across more than one simulator and couple these into one system and simulation. The TISC Suite software package includes several applications and interfaces to simulation programs and hardware that enable the control of the co-simulation and data exchange between the individual simulation models.

  * [FMI Suite](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/fmi-suite) – Simulation of simulator independent models
  > FMI Suite was developed by TLK to allow the configuration, import and simulation of individual FMU models in different simulators. The software is based on the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard that defines the interface formats of Functional Mockup Units (FMUs).

  * [DaVE](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/dave) – Software package for visualizing thermal systems
  > DaVE is a visualization and simulation environment that is suitable for both the post-processing and the online display of dynamic data sets. DaVE supports a number of data sources, not only of various formats but also online connections to simulations and measurement data. Many different visualization tools are available, which can be arranged and configured freely.

  * [ClaRa](https://www.tlk-thermo.com/index.php/en/software-products/clara) – Simulation of **Cla** usius - **Ra** nkine cycles
  > ClaRa, developed by TLK and XRG Simulation, is an open source software library of power plant components programmed in the modeling language Modelica which enables the user to simulate the dynamic behavior of power plants and to answer current questions about power plant operation. Please learn more about ClaRa and download the library for free on the official website.

[from the FAQ:] The program uses equations for the thermodynamic and transport properties to calculate the state points of the fluid or mixture. These equations are the most accurate equations available world wide. A link to one of these equations for R-125 is given below. Their high accuracy is obtained through many coefficients in the equations, and thus the calculation speed will be slower than other equations such as the Peng-Robinson cubic equations. The equations are generally valid over the entire vapor and liquid regions of the fluid, including supercritical states; the upper temperature limit is usually near the point of decomposition of the fluid, and the upper pressure (or density) limit is defined by the melting line of the substance."

  * [JTHERGAS](https://github.com/blurock/Thermodynamics/tree/master/JTherGas)
  > JTHERGAS (a JAVA implementation of THERGAS) estimates thermodynamic information from two dimensional graphical representations of molecules and radicals based on the Benson additivity method. The main use of this method is within automatic combustion mechanism generation systems where fast estimation of a large number and variety of chemical species is needed. The implementation strategy is based on meta-atom definitions and substructure analysis allowing a highly extensible database without modification of the core algorithms. Several interfaces for the database and the calculations are provided from terminal line commands, to graphical interfaces to web-services. The first order estimation of thermodynamics is based summing up the contributions of each heavy atom bonding description. Second order corrections due to steric hindrance and ring strain are made. Automatic estimate of contributions due to internal, external and optical symmetries are also made. Radicals are calculated by taking the difference due to the lost of hydrogen radicals taking into account changes in symmetry, spin, rotations, vibrations and steric hindrances. The software is public domain.The project is still under development, but a development version is visible on the following link. Login as ‘Guest’ (just press the guest button). Click through the ‘Thermodynamic Queries(upper left hand box) and again ‘Thermodynamic Queries’ (again upper left hand box) This brings you to the menu for entering a Nancy Linear Form (similar toSMILES) to calculate the thermodynamic quantities.
